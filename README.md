# TimeSeriesAnalysis

Python scripts related to phase space reconstruction and recurrence analysis, used for dynamical systems and time series analysis. The code includes implementations for reconstructing phase space, processing pages, recurrence plots, and other related computations.

## Features
- **Phase Space Reconstruction**: Reconstructs the state space of a system using time-delay embedding.
- **Recurrence Analysis**: Implements recurrence plots to analyze system behavior over time.
- **Data Processing**: Provides functions for handling and preprocessing time series data.
- **Visualization**: Generates plots to illustrate reconstructed trajectories and recurrence structures.

## File Overview
- `phase_space.py` - Implements phase space reconstruction techniques.
- `recurrence_page.py` - Generates and analyzes recurrence plots.
- `reconstructed_page.py` - Handles post-processing of reconstructed data.
- `process_page.py` - Prepares data for phase space and recurrence analysis.
- `root.py` - Main script integrating all components.
- `test.py` - Contains test cases for validation.
